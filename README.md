# ImageTracerUnity
This is a modified port of ImageTracer by Andr√°s Jankovics for Unity.
The starting point was ImageTracer.NET by Michael Yanni which is a .NET port of ImageTracer Java.
This port will try to optimize for Unity so many of the .NET niceties like Linq will be stripped out in favor of performance. Modifications in quantization will also be adapted from Miguel Lemos update to ImageTracer Java. There is no guarantee that the final output will resemble the ImageTracer.NET starting point.

Open to whatever changes. For performance updates, please provide data rather than opinion.
